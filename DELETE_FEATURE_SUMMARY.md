// In App component
const handleDeleteSchool = (key: string) => {
  const updated = { ...customSchools };
  delete updated[key];
  setCustomSchools(updated);
  localStorage.setItem("customSchools", JSON.stringify(updated));

  // Clear selection if deleted school was active
  if (selectedSchool === key) {
    setSelectedSchool("");
    setVersions([]);
  }
};
