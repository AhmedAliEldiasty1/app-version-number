## Understanding Sync Behavior

### Merge Logic

Cloud sync **merges** data rather than replacing:

**Example 1: Upload**
- Local schools: School A, School B
- Cloud schools: School C
- After upload: School A, School B, School C (in cloud)

**Example 2: Download**
- Local schools: School A, School B
- Cloud schools: School C, School D
- After download: School A, School B, School C, School D (locally)

**Example 3: Conflict**
- Local: School A (URL: http://old.com)
- Cloud: School A (URL: http://new.com)
- After download: School A (URL: http://new.com) ‚Üê Cloud version wins

### What Gets Synced

**Synced:**
- ‚úÖ Custom schools you added
- ‚úÖ School name
- ‚úÖ Student API URL
- ‚úÖ Parent API URL
- ‚úÖ Teacher API URL

**NOT Synced:**
- ‚ùå Built-in schools (AlQalam, Alwelan, Alaqlam, etc.)
- ‚ùå Selected school
- ‚ùå Selected app type
- ‚ùå Active tab

## Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Enable cloud sync on all your devices
- Upload before switching devices
- Download when first opening on a new device
- Keep cloud sync enabled for automatic updates
- Upload after making many changes

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Don't share your Firebase config publicly (if using private security rules)
- Don't delete from cloud unless you're sure
- Don't disable sync if you want automatic updates
- Don't modify Firebase database directly (use the app)

## Troubleshooting

### Changes don't sync between devices

**Check:**
1. Is "Enable Cloud Sync" toggled ON on both devices?
2. Do both devices have internet connection?
3. Did you upload from first device before downloading on second?
4. Check browser console (F12) for error messages

**Solution:**
- Toggle OFF then ON to restart sync
- Manually click "Upload to Cloud" then "Download from Cloud"
- Verify Firebase setup is correct

### Upload button is disabled

**Cause:** You don't have any custom schools yet

**Solution:**
- Add at least one custom school using the "Add School" button
- Upload button will become enabled automatically

### "Permission denied" error

**Cause:** Firestore Security Rules are too restrictive

**Solution:**
- Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules
- Verify rules allow read/write access
- See [Firebase Setup Guide](./FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md) Step 5

### Data appears but then disappears

**Cause:** Real-time sync is overwriting your data

**Solution:**
- This means someone else deleted it from another device
- Or you have conflicting data between devices
- Upload your local data to restore it

### Slow sync performance

**Cause:** Many schools or slow internet

**Solution:**
- Cloud sync is fast for normal use (<100 schools)
- Check your internet connection speed
- Consider disabling real-time sync if not needed
- Use manual Upload/Download instead

## Data Privacy & Security

### Your Data
- Stored in Google Firebase (secure Google servers)
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Encrypted at rest (Firebase default)
- Subject to Firebase security rules you set

### Privacy Options

**Public (Option A in setup guide):**
- Anyone with Firebase config can read/write
- Good for: Small teams, shared school lists
- Not recommended for: Sensitive school data

**Read-Only for Others (Option B):**
- Anyone can read, only you can write
- Requires: Firebase Authentication
- Good for: Publishing school lists

**Private (Option C):**
- Only authenticated users can read/write
- Requires: Firebase Authentication
- Good for: Personal use, sensitive data

### Best Practices
- Use Option B or C for production
- Don't share Firebase config publicly if using private mode
- Regularly backup your data
- Monitor Firebase Console for unexpected access

## FAQ

**Q: Does cloud sync work offline?**  
A: Manual buttons require internet. Real-time sync requires internet. Local storage works offline.

**Q: Can I use cloud sync without Firebase?**  
A: No, Firebase is required for cloud sync. Alternative: Use localStorage (works offline but no sync).

**Q: How much does Firebase cost?**  
A: Firebase has a generous free tier (1GB storage, 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day). For this app, free tier is more than enough for personal/small team use.

**Q: Can I sync with multiple Firebase projects?**  
A: You can only use one Firebase project at a time. To switch, update `src/utils/firebase.ts` with new config.

**Q: What happens if I delete a school on one device?**  
A: If cloud sync is enabled, it will be deleted from cloud and all connected devices automatically. If not enabled, only deleted locally.

**Q: Can I recover deleted schools?**  
A: No automatic recovery. Best practice: Upload before making major deletions as a backup.

**Q: How many schools can I sync?**  
A: Firebase free tier allows 1GB storage. Each school ~1KB = ~1 million schools (practically unlimited).

**Q: Does cloud sync affect app performance?**  
A: Minimal impact. Real-time sync uses efficient WebSocket connection. Initial download depends on number of schools.

**Q: Can I see sync history?**  
A: Not in the app. You can view Firestore Database in Firebase Console to see all schools and when they were last updated.
